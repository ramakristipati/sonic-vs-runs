Scenario-4: Verify If TACACS+ Authentication is enabled, a new PAM configuration file ?common-auth-sonic? is created. Scenario-5: Verify that user is able to execute the ?TACACS-server key command successfully in appropriate mode. Scenario-6: Verify that authentication to a TACACS server will only take place if the NAS and the server are configured with the same shared key"
